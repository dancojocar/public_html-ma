<div class="section">L1 - Project Details</div>
<ul>
    <li style="color: red">Due: second laboratory</li>
    <li>See the requirements from the github classroom project associated with your group.</li>

        Assignment plan:
        <ul>
            <li style="color: red">Final due: last laboratory before winter holiday</li>
            <li>Per functionality:
                <ul>
                    <li>The application without local persistence and remote access - due: first laboratory from
                        November, for 100% of the grade. Last laboratory from November, for 70% of the project grade.
                    </li>
                    <li>Local persistence (using an db engine, no files or settings are allowed!) - due: last laboratory from November, for 100% of the grade. First laboratory
                        from December, for 70% of the project grade.
                    </li>
                    <li>Server integration - due: first laboratory from December, for 100% of the grade. Last laboratory
                        from December, for 70% of the project grade.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="color: red">NOTE: The deadlines are final! After the last laboratory, from December, we are not
                grading L2 results anymore!
            </li>
            <li>
                <div style="color: red">In order to meet the deadlines, you need to ensure that the last commit, for the
                    work, was done in the previous day of the laboratory day!
                </div>
                Eg. If your last laboratory in November is on Monday November 26th, then the commit date should be
                before Monday November 26th 00:00 hours (GMT+2).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Implement in BOTH:
        <ul>
            <li>Native (iOs(Swift or Obj-C) or Android(Java or Kotlin))</li>
            <li>Non-native (Flutter or React-Native or NativeScript or Any other mobile multi-platform framework)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The application should offer CRUD operations on the business objects. The main screen should be a list of the
        business objects and it should allow at least the following operations:
        <ul>
            <li>Create - create new elements that will be added to the list.</li>
            <li>Read - present the elements in a list.</li>
            <li>Update - allow the user to update an element found in the list.</li>
            <li>Delete - delete existing elements from the list.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>The application should <b>persist</b> the content locally, to be able to allow <b>offline</b> access. And while
        online it should <b>synchronize</b> the content with a remote <b>server</b> (implemented also by you, in the
        language of your choice, <b>NO</b> server-less solutions are allowed yet).
        The communication with the server should be managed using <b>REST</b> services, and it should have counterpart
        operations for <b>each</b> of the operations mentioned above.
        While offline the application will perform the following actions:
        <ul>
            <li>On update and delete - a message will be displayed, that the application is offline and the operation is
                not available.
            </li>
            <li>On read - the content from the local database will be displayed.</li>
            <li>On create - the input will be persisted in the local database and when the application will detect that
                the device is able to connect to the server will push all the created entries, while the device was
                offline.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="section">L2 - Bonus Project</div>
<ul>
    <li style="color: red">Due: last laboratory from January</li>
    <li>
        Will be a continuation of the L2 project but <b>ONLY</b> on one platform (from: Swift, Obj-C, Java, Kotlin,
        Flutter, React-Native, Native-Scripts).
    </li>
    <li>
        Will receive extra bonus points for:
        <ul>
            <li>+1 point for supporting external authentication providers: google, facebook, etc. (firebase-auth is
                OK).
            </li>
            <li>+1 point for using multiple user roles.</li>
            <li>+2 points for using server-less persistence (like: firebase-database/realtime/firestore).</li>
            <li>+1 point for using animations.</li>
            <li>+1 point at least a unit test for one of the CRUD operations.</li>
            <li>+1 point the app was published on Google Play.</li>
            <li>+1 point the app was published on Apple Store.</li>
            <li>+2 points the app has at least 50 users on Google Play + Apple Store.</li>
            <li>+1 point for using RxJava/RxSwift/RxKotlin</li>
            <li>+1 point for using Material Design</li>
            <li>+1 point for using a bug-tracking system, like: firebase analytics, bugsnag</li>
            <li>+1 point for using AdMob or something similar</li>
            <li>+1 point for having in-app purchases.</li>
            <li>+1 point for using a NavigationDrawer.</li>
            <li>+1 point for giving the user the choice to toggle some app settings.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="section">Final grade</div>
<ul>
    <li>MP(L2 - Main Project Grade) = (L2Native + L2Non-native) / 2</li>
    <li>LG(Laboratory Grade) = if(MP >= 4.5) min(10, L1 * 0.1 + MP * 0.6 + L3 * 0.3) else 0</li>
    <li>EG(Exam Grade) - the grade from the practical exam</li>
    <li>FG(Final Grade) = if(LG >= 4.5 && EG >= 5 ) LG * 0.6 + EG * 0.4 else 0</li>
    <li>Note: In order to take the practical exam you need to have at least 90% of the laboratory presences.</li>
    <li>If LG < 4.5 or the presences criteria are not meet, than you are allowed to attend only the practical exam in
        the re-examination session. For this case, the practical exam will have a different requirement, to cover the
        laboratory grade too.
